Goal

Build a simple rule-based chatbot that responds to basic user input with predefined replies.

"hello"

"how are you"

Key Concepts Used

if-elif statements (decision-making)

Loops (to keep the chat running)

Console input/output (text interaction)

Sample Interaction
Chatbot: Hello! You can talk to me. (Type 'bye' to exit)
You: hello

You: how are you
Chatbot: I'm fine, thanks!
You: bye
